    { Name: "Harry", review: "My doggo just loves it. She has always been a pedigree lover. This chicken n vegetable flavor has made her even skip the home food.It does have fillers but lesser than the other brands. She prefers having pedigree.I will recommend this product." },
    { Name: "Karthik", review: "I've fed my Labrador puppy on this from the age of 3 months up to now 10 months and he loves it and is now almost fully grown. Despite what it says on the packet I've been advised by my vet that I should now consider changing to an adult version." },
    { Name: "Xian-wu", review: "My cat is quiet selective when it comes to food. Sheeba premium wet foods are exception and turns out that this is his favourite among the wet meals that we have tried so far.This wet cat food is very good for my cat's complete and balanced diet." },
    { Name: "Zendaya", review: "The pellet size is mini and floats on water and ideal for small fish. My platy and swordtail love it and eat with gusto, no leftovers ever. It doesn't cloud the water. After using it for 2 months, I think this is a good brand of fish food." },
    { Name: "Maguire", review: "The Whisker's chicken loaf meal also contains essential vitamins and minerals, so this premium palate for your cat delivers a mouth-watering feast, without compromising on the goodness. It gives my cat the satisfying taste of premium cat food." },
